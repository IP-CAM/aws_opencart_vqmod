Amazon S3 Downloads extension provides support for Amazon Simple Storage
Service (Amazon S3). It allows you to serve your downloadable files from
Amazon storage. Download link expires in 15 minutes.

It may be needed for those who are selling downloadable content, like eBooks
or music  and want to provide reliable and fast download for their store.
It is especially useful when selling huge files, like videos. Storing content
in your Amazon S3 bucket rather than on your application server reduces load on
the server and overall costs.

This plugin is different than
[Amazon S3 Basic Integration|http://www.opencart.com/index.php?route=extension/extension/info&extension_id=4429].
It has simplified installation and does not have Pro version (where you can
upload your files to S3 from Opencart).

Lateser Version 1.0.3, verified with OpenCart versions 1.5.1.1 and 1.5.2.1 (Should work on OpenCart version >= 1.4)

To Install:

1. Install [VQMod](http://code.google.com/p/vqmod/) before installing this plugin.
2 .Upload archive content into your cart installation directory.
3. Specify Amazon S3 credentials at System => Settings, there for your store see AWS tab.
4. Enter your Amazon S3 Bucket, Access Key and Security Key and save.

That's it!

Add your downloads the usual way WITHOUT uploading actual file, just set name and save. Then go to Amazon Console and upload file with the name to necessary bucket.

If you have existing downloads you need to upload all files to Amazon S3, otherwise they will not be possible download.
